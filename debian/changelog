fonts-source-code-pro (2.010R-ro-1.030R-it-0local1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Initial "local" package -- not uploaded to Debian as it is not
    entirely clear what the copyright situation for the toolchain is
    
  * Packaging based on
     - package fonts-inconsolata (001.010-3)
     - https://gist.github.com/lucasdavila/3875946
    with thanks to both
